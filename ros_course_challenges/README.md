# ROS course challenges

These files that are provided in my gitlab repository are the python files of the individual challenges. 

In each challenge * folder you can find a file with name ***"tb3.py"*** 

Copy the tb3.py file and paste outside where you have the other files like run-for-sim.sh.

run python3 tb3.py

All the relevant information has been added in my ROS documentation
